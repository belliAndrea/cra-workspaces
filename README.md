> All you have to do is create your app using [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) and install cra-workspaces.

⚠️ **Please Note:**

> By doing this you're breaking the ["guarantees"](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/issues/99#issuecomment-234657710) that CRA provides. That is to say you now "own" the configs. **No support** will be provided. Proceed with caution.

The goal of this package is to make a monorepo using [yarn workspaces](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/workspaces/) to share common code across a Create React App 2+ (CRA).
It runs create-react-app with yarn workspaces without config files or using 'eject'

# Getting started

-   "build": "react-scripts build",
